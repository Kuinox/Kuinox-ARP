# Kuinox.ARP
The purpose of this simple package is to provide a simple API for ARP (nothing more !).

Currently it only parse the ARP on Windows, but linux support is planned.

You cannot modify the arp table with this library, but I happilly accept PR to support it.

The code base is made to be extremly simple so anyone can understand it.
